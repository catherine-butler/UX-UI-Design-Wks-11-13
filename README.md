# UX-UI-Design-Wks-11-15

**Retrospective Wed 16 June**
 https://metroretro.io/board/LBBO9LIUPI59
 
 **Outcomes from this** 
 Going forward:
      - do we need to reasses our goals: should the question be "what do we need to be happy to submit?"
      - review features
      - prioritise them in order of need and make changes
 
 Coming up:
      - Collectively research and brainstorm the code needed in the app 
      - As pairs: pseudo code these features
      - Design chats: need a clear strucutre of how to tackle/make decisions and put a time limit on discussions
      - End each group session with timescales for next meeting and delegate tasks to do between now and then
